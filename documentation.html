    <div style="white-space:pre">
      install [pkg]: Installs a pkg
      remove [pkg]: Removes a pkg
      install-crate/create-crate: Refer to "Crates"
      update: Update all your packages

    <h4>Crates</h4>
    <p4>Crates are a file (.mbc) that contain data about multiple packages and how to configure them. You can install them with `mb install-crate`. It automates installing a bunch of packages with configs (like if your moving systems). You can run `mb create-crate` to create a crate from your current configs.</p4>
    <h5>Shards</h5>
    <p5>Shards are places you can download your packages from, there are currently two: `stable` and `unstable`. We are working on custom shards (like if a package is not on the main shards you can download it off another)</p5>
